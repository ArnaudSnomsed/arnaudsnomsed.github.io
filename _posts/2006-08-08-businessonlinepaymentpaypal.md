Here is a Perl module I wrote providing a Business::OnlinePayment interface for PayPal. It uses Business::PayPal::API for doing PayPal DirectPayments (using credit cards) so itâ€™s transparent for the end-user that will not even now that we use PayPal. It should be used with [Freeside](http://www.sisd.com/freeside/) (Open-source billing software and outsourced billing services for ISPs) but I used it only with the paypal sandbox so it might need some adjustements.

```
package Business::OnlinePayment::PayPal;

use strict;
use warnings;
use Carp;
use Business::OnlinePayment;
use Data::Dumper;
use Business::PayPal::API qw(DirectPayments);

our @ISA = qw(Business::OnlinePayment);
our @EXPORT = qw();
our @EXPORT_OK = qw();
our $VERSION = '0.1';

# Since there's no standard format for expiration dates, we try to do our best
# (copied from Business::OnlinePayment::InternetSecure

sub parse_expdate {
        my ($self, $str) = @_;

        my ($y, $m);
        if ($str =~ /^(\d{4})\W(\d{1,2})$/ ||# YYYY.MM  or  YYYY-M
            $str =~ /^(\d\d)\W(\d)$/ ||# YY/M  or  YY-M
            $str =~ /^(\d\d)[.-](\d\d)$/) {# YY-MM
                ($y, $m) = ($1, $2);
        } elsif ($str =~ /^(\d{1,2})\W(\d{4})$/ ||# MM-YYYY  or  M/YYYY
