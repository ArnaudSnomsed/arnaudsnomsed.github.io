I finally released my first own version of Vulture, with this bunch of new features :

- Application’s session timeout configuration![](/img/dilber.png)
- « Host » header overwriting (no more workaround with /etc/hosts)
- Authentication is now possible with only one name or IP (sso portal name can be the same as an application name).
- New CSS (click on the top banner to switch)
- « Check for update » link

You can download it [here](http://arnaud.desmons.free.fr/wordpress/?page_id=25). Comments and feature requests are more than welcome. [Screenshots](http://arnaud.desmons.free.fr/wordpress/?page_id=26) are also available.
